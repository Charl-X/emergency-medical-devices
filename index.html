  <h2>Introduction to the Project</h2>
  <div style="text-align: left;">
    <p>Emergency situations require bystanders to act fast. This manual aims to give prior exposure to common medical devices used in emergency situations, including EpiPens, Narcan, glucose injections, and Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs). Knowing how to operate these devices before an emergency can save countless lives.</p>

  <h2>General Information for Emergency Medical Situations</h2>
  <div style="text-align: left;">
    <p><b>Check to Ensure the Scene is Safe</b></p>
    <p>Make sure the person experiencing the emergency is in a safe location for you to help them. If there is any type of danger present, you should immediately call emergency services and refrain from assisting.</p>
    <p><b>Immediately call emergency services (911) if someone is:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Unresponsive</p>
        <p>To check for responsiveness:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Tap their shoulders with considerable force, not enough to hurt them, but enough to get a response from the individual.</li>
          <li>Yell at them, “Are you okay?”</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Not breathing</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Listen to their breathing. If they are only gasping for air, you still need to call for 911.</li>
          <li>Look for their chest to rise and fall.</li>
          <li>Checking for breathing should take no more than ten seconds.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

## About the Project

This is a project for the University of Pittsburghâ€™s Introduction to Technical Writing (ENGCMP 0600) taught by Stephen Quigley. This project seeks to inform people of emergency medical devices and their proper usages. Prior exposure to these devices before an emergency arises will save countless lives by informing bystanders on how to properly use these devices.
Our manual is organized as follows:
1. Intro
2. EpiPen Guide
3. Narcan Guide
4. AED Guide
5. Glucagon Injection Guide
